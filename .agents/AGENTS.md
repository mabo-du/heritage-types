# Agent Instructions

This directory contains project-specific agent context. The [aidevops](https://aidevops.sh)
framework is loaded separately via the global config (`~/.aidevops/agents/`).

## Purpose

Files in `.agents/` provide project-specific instructions that AI assistants
read when working in this repository. Use this for:

- Domain-specific conventions not covered by the framework
- Project architecture decisions and patterns
- API design rules, data models, naming conventions
- Integration details (third-party services, deployment targets)

## Adding Agents

Create `.md` files in this directory for domain-specific context:

```text
.agents/
  AGENTS.md              # This file - overview and index
  api-patterns.md        # API design conventions
  deployment.md          # Deployment procedures
  data-model.md          # Database schema and relationships
```

Each file is read on demand by AI assistants when relevant to the task.

## Security

### Prompt Injection Defense

Any feature that processes untrusted content (tool outputs, user input, webhook
payloads) and passes it to an LLM must defend against prompt injection. This is
a JS/TS project — use `@stackone/defender` to sanitize untrusted tool results
before they enter the LLM context:

```bash
npm install @stackone/defender
```

```typescript
import { createPromptDefense } from '@stackone/defender';

const defense = createPromptDefense({ enableTier2: true, blockHighRisk: true });

// Sanitize untrusted tool output before adding to LLM context
const result = await defense.defendToolResult(toolResponse, 'tool_name');
if (!result.allowed) {
  throw new Error('Blocked untrusted content');
}
const safeContent = result.sanitized;
```

For features that don't use LLMs but process untrusted text (webhooks, form
submissions, API endpoints), validate and sanitize inputs at the boundary.

### General Security Rules

- Never log or expose API keys, tokens, or credentials in output
- Store secrets via `aidevops secret set <NAME>` (gopass-encrypted) or
  environment variables — never hardcode them in source
- Use `<PLACEHOLDER>` values in code examples; note the secure storage location
- Validate all external input (user input, webhook payloads, API responses)
- Pin third-party GitHub Actions to SHA hashes, not branch tags
- Run `aidevops security audit` periodically to check security posture
- See `~/.aidevops/agents/tools/security/prompt-injection-defender.md` for
  the framework's prompt injection defense patterns
