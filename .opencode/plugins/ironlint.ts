/**
 * IronLint OpenCode plugin.
 *
 *   - `tool.execute.before` on `edit`/`write` → compute the proposed
 *      content and pipe it to `ironlint check --file <path> --content -`
 *      on stdin. The real file at `filePath` is never written or read
 *      back — the check only ever sees the proposed bytes. Throw on block
 *      so OpenCode never executes the tool (exit-code contract: 0 =
 *      pass/warn, 2 = block).
 *
 * IronLint itself is invoked as a child process via the async `Bun.spawn`
 * (awaited inside the async before-hook). The plugin contains no rule
 * logic — it's purely a translation layer between OpenCode's lifecycle
 * and the `ironlint` CLI. Spawn failures (missing binary) and signal death
 * are normalized into the internal-error tier (fail-open by default,
 * fail-closed under `IRONLINT_FAIL_CLOSED_ON_INTERNAL=1`) — never a block.
